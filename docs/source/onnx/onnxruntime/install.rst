Install
=======

Official installation doc: `<https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/install/>`_.

One thing to note is that the so-called pre-built ``mobile packages``
contain only a subset of the operators, while the pre-built ``full packages``
contain all the operators.

See `<https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/custom.html>`_ for a custom build.

See `<https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/inferencing.html>`_ for building for inferencing.
