   <rev>^[<n>], e.g. HEAD^, v1.5.1^0
     A suffix ^ to a revision parameter means the first parent of that commit object.  ^<n> means the <n>th parent
     (i.e.  <rev>^ is equivalent to <rev>^1). As a special rule, <rev>^0 means the commit itself and is used when
     <rev> is the object name of a tag object that refers to a commit object.

   <rev>~[<n>], e.g. HEAD~, master~3
     A suffix ~ to a revision parameter means the first parent of that commit object. A suffix ~<n> to a revision
     parameter means the commit object that is the <n>th generation ancestor of the named commit object, following
     only the first parents. I.e.  <rev>~3 is equivalent to <rev>^^^ which is equivalent to <rev>^1^1^1. See below
     for an illustration of the usage of this form.
